Address Book for Android Studio

This repo contains a sample address book application for Android Studio that demonstrates how to use the DreamFactory REST API. It includes new user registration, user login, and CRUD for related tables.
Getting DreamFactory on your local machine

To download and install DreamFactory, follow the instructions here. Alternatively, you can create a free hosted developer account at www.dreamfactory.com if you don't want to install DreamFactory locally.
Configuring your DreamFactory instance to run the app

    Enable CORS for development purposes.
        In the admin console, navigate to the Config tab and click on CORS in the left sidebar.
        Click Add.
        Set Origin, Paths, and Headers to *.
        Set Max Age to 0.
        Allow all HTTP verbs and check the Enabled box.
        Click update when you are done.
        More info on setting up CORS is available here.

    Create a default role for new users and enable open registration
        In the admin console, click the Roles tab then click Create in the left sidebar.
        Enter a name for the role and check the Active box.
        Go to the Access tab.
        Add a new entry under Service Access (you can make it more restrictive later).
            set Service = All
            set Component = *
            check all HTTP verbs under Access
            set Requester = API
        Click Create Role.
        Click the Services tab, then edit the user service. Go to Config and enable Allow Open Registration.
        Set the Open Reg Role Id to the name of the role you just created.
        Make sure Open Reg Email Service Id is blank, so that new users can register without email confirmation.
        Save changes.

    Import the package file for the app.
        From the Apps tab in the admin console, click Import and click Select 'Andriod Address Book' 'to select the package apps' in the list of sample apps. The Address Book package contains the application description, schemas, and sample data.
        Or Click Browe button to look for downlowad packge and look for file that end with .dfpkg if you have already download it from github
        Leave storage service and folder blank. This is a native Android app so it requires no file storage on the server.
        Click the Import button. If successful, your app will appear on the Apps tab. You may have to refresh the page to see your new app in the list.

    Make sure you have a SQL database service named 'db'. Depending on how you installed DreamFactory you may or may not have a 'db' service already available on your instance. You can add one by going to the Services tab in the admin console and creating a new SQL service. Make sure you set the name to 'db'.

Running the Address Book app

Almost there! Clone this repo to your local machine then open and run the project with Android Studio. To open the project select the android-sdk/android-sdk directory.

Before running the project you need to edit API_KEY in the file AppConstants.java to match the key for your new app. This key can be found by selecting your app from the list on the Apps tab in the admin console.

If your DreamFactory instance is on localhost, make sure the INSTANCE_URL in AppConstants.java is set to the emulator localhost IP of 10.0.2.2. Make sure the port numbers match.

String INSTANCE_URL = "http://10.0.2.2:8080/api/v2";

If your instance is not on localhost, set INSTANCE_URL to point to the proper location.

String INSTANCE_URL = "http://my-df-instance.example.com/api/v2";

When the app starts up you can register a new user, or log in as an existing user. Currently the app does not support registering and logging in admin users.
Example API calls

The app uses the Apache client HTTP library to send REST requests. The request formatting is exposed in case you want to roll your own code or use a third party library to send requests.

The general form of a DreamFactory REST API call is:

<rest-verb> http[s]://<server-name>/api/v2/[<service-api-name>]/[<resource-path>][?<param-name>=<param-value>]

An Android call looks like this:

private String invokeAPIInternal(String host,
                                String path,
                                String method,
                                Map<String, String> queryParams,
                                String body,
                                Map<String, String> headerParams,
                                String contentType) throws ApiException


Breaking down each parameter:

    path Holds the value of http[s]://<server-name>/api/v2/[<service-api-name>]/[<resource-path>] from the generic call. You can include the query parameters here. However, it is easier and cleaner to pass in the query parameters as a map than it is to format them into the url.
    method The HTTP verb.
    queryParams Holds the query parameters.
    body Serialized request body, formatted as either a JSON or XML
    headerParams Users using 1.* need to include the session id and the application name.
    contentType Either json or xml.

There is a lot of boilerplate code for Java because requests need to run asynchronously and you need to check for exceptions. To help keep things clean, we provide a base request class that extends AsyncTask. The light weight class handles boilerplate from error handling and request formatting with almost no extra overhead.
User login

{ // part of doSetup
  serviceName = "user";
  endPoint = "session";

  verb = "POST";

  // post email and password to get back session token
  // need session token to make every call other than login and challenge
  requestBody = new JSONObject();
  requestBody.put("email", mEmail);
  requestBody.put("password", mPassword);

  // include application API key
  applicationApiKey = AppConstants.API_KEY;
}

@Override
protected void processResponse(String response) throws ApiException, JSONException {
// store the session_token to be used later on
JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject(response);
String session_token = jsonObject.getString("session_token");
if(session_token.length() == 0){
    throw new ApiException(0, "did not get a valid session token in the response");
}
PrefUtil.putString(getApplicationContext(), AppConstants.SESSION_TOKEN, session_token);
}

Database
Selecting records (to get or delete)

    Using filters

    queryParams = new HashMap<>();
    // filter to only get the contact_info records related to the contact
    queryParams.put("filter", "contact_id=" + contactRecord.id);

    Copy

    Related records

    // filter to only get the contact_group_relationships we want
    queryParams = new HashMap<>();
    queryParams.put("filter", "contact_group_id=" + groupId);

    // request without related would return just {id, contact_group_id, contact_id}
    // set the related field to go get the contact records referenced by
    // each contact_group_relationship record
    queryParams.put("related", "contact_by_contact_id");

    Using id_fields

    // since we don't know the contact_group_relationship ids, change the id field to id
    queryParams = new HashMap<>();
    queryParams.put("id_field", "id");

    // form of request is { "resource": [... ids ...] }
    requestBody = new JSONObject();
    requestBody.put("resource", idArray);

    Records by id

    // delete contact records by record id
    // need to remove '[' and ']' from JSON array because ids doesn't take JSON
    queryParams = new HashMap<>();
    queryParams.put("ids", idArray.toString().replace("[", "").replace("]", ""));


Updating records

// send the record to patch, need to include record id
//requestString = "{\"name\":\"" + record.name + "\",\"id\":" +
        //record.id + "}";
// form is { "id": id, "name":name }
requestString = ApiInvoker.serialize(record);

Creating records

// only need to send the group name in body
// we don't have a group ID yet, so we can't provide one here
requestString = "{\"name\":\"" + name + "\"}";
